const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');

// Create a new Three.js scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene();

// Create a new Three.js camera
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);

// Create a new Three.js renderer
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

// Set the size of the renderer
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);

// Append the renderer to the canvas
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Create a new Three.js cube
const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);

// Add the cube to the scene
scene.add(cube);

// Create a new Three.js light
const light = new THREE.AmbientLight(0xffffff);

// Add the light to the scene
scene.add(light);

// Render the scene
renderer.render(scene, camera);
```

**Documentation**

This code creates a simple 3D game using the Three.js library. The game consists of a single cube that can be rotated by clicking and dragging on the canvas.

The `index.html` file contains the HTML code for the game. The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code for the game.

The `script.js` file first gets the canvas element from the HTML document. Then, it creates a new Three.js scene, camera, and renderer. The renderer is then set to the size of the canvas, and the renderer is appended to the canvas.

Next, the code creates a new Three.js cube and adds it to the scene. The cube is given a green color.

Finally, the code creates a new Three.js light and adds it to the scene. The light is set to a white color.

The code then renders the scene using the renderer and camera.

**Implementation Details**

The following are some of the key implementation details of the code:

* The `Three.js` library is used to create the 3D scene, camera, and renderer.
* The `canvas` element is used to display the 3D scene.
* The `geometry` and `material` objects are used to create the cube.
* The `light` object is used to illuminate the scene.
* The `renderer` object is used to render the scene to the canvas.

**Additional Notes**

This code is just a starting point for creating a simple 3D game. You can add additional features to the game, such as:

* Adding more objects to the scene
* Adding physics to the objects
* Adding a score system
* Adding a user interface
